# smalldata

A curated list of resources for beginner-level data manipulation in Python.

Please help flesh it out with suggestions of more resources!

Rather than a list of data-handling or data science resources in 
general, which would be very long and not very useful, I want to 
produce a list specifically helpful to very new Python learners 
and those helping them learn.

## General resources

- Catherine Devlin PyCon2018 keynote: ["small data" slides](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/talks/blob/master/pycon_2018/smalldata.rst), ["small data" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kta4GB3PAw)
- [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Main_Page)

## Books, tutorials, and curricula
